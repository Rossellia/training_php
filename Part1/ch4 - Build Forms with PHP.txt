          <input type="hidden" name="visible" value="0" />
          <input type="checkbox" name="visible" value="1" />

-when a checkbox isn't checked, html won't be send any data for visible, so we use hidden to send value 0

-form data is saved in superglobal variable $_POST, assigned by PHP before processing page code. We also don't need to encode form parameters

-detect form submission
    test if a key parameter has a value
    test if submit parameter was sent
    test if REQUEST_METHOD is post $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] ===='POST'

-single-page form processing - form that submits to itself
    all logic related to the form in one file
    redisplay the form on errors
    return error messages
    populate fields with previous values
