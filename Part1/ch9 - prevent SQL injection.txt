-sql injection
    -execute arbitrary sql requests
    -craft string to manipulate sql syntax and inject code
    -url parameters, form data, cookies, database data
-sqli
-single biggest security concern
-ranked #1 security threat by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)


-easy for attackers to detect and exploit
-gives access to large amounts of important data
-web applications have high level of access
-circumvents normal access controls


-bypass application authentication
-steal data
-alter data
-destroy data

sanitize data
-convert characters with meaning in sql syntax to data
-add a backslash before all single quotes
$subject['menu_name'] = "David\'s Story";

addslashes($string) - add slashes to characters
mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $string)


delimit data values
--single quotes REQUIRED for strings, dates, times
--single quotes NOT REQUIRED for numbers, booleans
-small performance penalty to convert to correct type
-large security benefit to quoting all values

-put single quotes around all values
-helps prevent sql injection
-forces attackers to circumvent data delimiters

prepared statements
-prepare statement once and reuse it many times
-can be faster
-prevent sql injection
