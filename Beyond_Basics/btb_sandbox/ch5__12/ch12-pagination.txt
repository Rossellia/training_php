It comes in handy when we have a lot of data. Returns a subset. List of all page number

Pagination requires two sets of information
-the subset of records on the current page
-information about the complete set of records

Keep track of three variables
-current page $current_page
-records per page $per_page
-total record count $total_count

Limit
-maximum records to Returns
-$per_page

Offset
-records to skip before returning records
-$per_page*($current_page-1)
-$per_page = 10, $offset = $per_page * ($current_page - 1)

SELECT * 
FROM photographs
LIMIT $per_page
OFFSET $offset;

Count
-count of how many records are in the database

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM photographs;
