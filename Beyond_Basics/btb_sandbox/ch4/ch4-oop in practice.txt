-extends == the child class inherits its behaviour from the parent class
-inherits the default behaviour of the class, not its instances
-we can override the characteristics of the main class

-public = everywhere
-private = in scope of the class
-protected = in scope of class and its subclasses

-var is the same thing as public

-with static, the attribute or the method is around even if there is no instance
-static variable is tied to the class itself
-static variables are shared between parents and children
-static is useful when we want, for example, to keep track of all students created, or the types of students that can be created, etc

-Student::$total_students
-Paamayim Nekudotayim
-paam = One
-ayim = Doubled
-nekudot = Dot
-ayim = Doubled
-Double Colon (in Hebrew)


-self is used to access static or class variables or methods and 
-this is used to access non-static or object variables or methods. 
-So use self when there is a need to access something which belongs 
-to a class and use $this when there is a need to access a property 
-belonging to the object of the class.

-when working with static methods, use parent::, but the only time
-we should use it with instance methods is when we're trying to
-actually access the parent method

-cloning will not change the values of the base class, only the current
-child class

-comparison operator == -have the same attributes
-identity operator === -point the same reference object

COMPARING OBJECTS
-references: == - yes === - yes
-instances with matching attributes: == - yes === - no
-instances with different attributes: == - no === - no
