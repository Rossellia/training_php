Models
-comment
-photograph
-user

--have a relationship with the database
--database_object can be considered model, pagination and session can be considered helpers instead


View
-index.php - top is considered controller, bottom is considered view
-refactoring == take things from the view and set them in the controller instead and take some things from the controller and push them into the model

----Data comes from the database to the model, from the model to the controller, from the controller to the view
----Controllers are getting things organized, making all the calls that need to be made, so that when it's done, we can render the view
----The view is the presentation layer, there isn't much complicated code in the view

------To fix the mistake of merging controllers with views, we can use templates


Templating
1.Set variables/include PHP file
2.Load file/search and replace

--libraries take certain common tasks that we do often and make them easier, having code that we can reuse, 
--a framework takes the overall process of web development and makes that something we can reuse, they also have predefined places where you put your code
