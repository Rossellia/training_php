__FILE__ - tells the file that is loaded
__LINE__ - tells the line number, it may not be what we expect with include files

Whenever a website is no longer in development and is available to the public:
-be vigilant about exposing your site to hacking
-create a separate directory for uploaded files
-develop permissions to give you and extra layer of defense
-grant as few permissions as it takes to get the job done

Who am I?
-often: nobody
-sometimes: www, apache

ls
ls -la 
ps aux | grep httpd

chown
chmod

sudo chown www file_permissions.php
sudo chmod 777 file_permissions.php
sudo chmod 744 file_permissions.php
sudo chmod 600 file_permissions.php
sudo chmod 666 file_permissions.php

Safe Mode
safe_mode - nu mai gasesc
--we can't manipulate files we don't own, so safe_mode can't be on -- nu mai exista
--chown unusable in php, well, it is not recommended, choose chmod instead

Accessing files
-fopen(filename, mode) --opens file whether it exists or not, if it doesn't exist, then it is created
                       -- r = read from start               ALTERNATE READ & WRITE -r+
                       --w =  truncate, write from start                           -w+
                       --a = append, write from end                                -a+
                       --x = write from start (can't exist)                        -x+

File line endings
-win                    \r\n 
-mac, linux, unix       \n


File mode modifiers
-t translate windows line endings (use \r\n)
-b binary mode(don't translate)
-b is the default on all platforms since PHP 4.3.2

sudo chmod 777 . --cand directorul curent nu are permisiunile necesare 

HANDLE DOESN'T WORK WITH CHMOD, IT ONLY WORKS WITH fwrite, fread, etc

To delete files we must close files first, can't delete open files. + Must have permission on folder containing the file.
