__autoload($class_name) -- when you forget to require/load a file, autoload takes care of that, but it's no longer supported
-use spl_autoload_register(function($class_name)) instead

LATE STATIC BINDING
-any time we use self in a static method, it refers to the actual object where it resides, not the class inheriting it
-when PHP loads up the DatabaseObject class, it binds every occurence of the word self to the class before the User class is even been defined
-the binding happens early, when it is created, not late, when the object is called
-$this always refers to the current instance

This problem is called early static bindings
-Workarounds:
--avoid static methods
--$user = User::find_by_id(1);
--$user = new User();
--$user = $User->find_by_id(1);

--deduce the class name 
--get_class()
--returns DatabaseObject

--LATE STATIC BINDINGS 
--get_called_class()
--static:: instead of self::
--static:: -- scope resolution operator to say I want you to make a late static binding, a binding that happends at runtime, 
           -- not back when you were defined, at the very beginning
